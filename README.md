## Robust Mencius

This repo as an implementation of Robust Mencius, MultiPaxos, and an implementation of Mencius to compare to.

For the scripts for how we setup and run the experiments, look at https://github.com/sidlak-c137/RobustMencius/blob/main/experiments/setup_and_run.txt

In the meantime, enjoy! This Python framework for running and benchmarking distributed systems was a lot of fun to write!
